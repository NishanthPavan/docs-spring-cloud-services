1. When the **Spring Cloud Services** tile appears in the **Installation Dashboard**, click it. In the **Settings** tab, click **Spring Cloud Services** to configure the **Service Instance Limit** setting. The value of this setting is the maximum number of service instances that the Spring Cloud Services service broker will allow to be provisioned (the default value is 100). This setting's value is also used to determine the memory quota for the org in which service instances are deployed; that org's quota will be equal to 1.5G times the configured service instance limit.
