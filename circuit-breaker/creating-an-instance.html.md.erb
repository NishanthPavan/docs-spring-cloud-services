<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can create a Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance using either the cf Command Line Interface tool or [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Apps Manager.

## Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf target -o myorg -s development

API endpoint:   https://api.cf.wise.com (API version: 2.43.0)
User:           user
Org:            myorg
Space:          development
</pre>

If desired, view plan details for the Circuit Breaker Dashboard product using
`cf marketplace -s`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org myorg / space development as user...
OK

p-service-registry            standard       Service Registry for Spring Cloud Applications

TIP:  Use 'cf marketplace -s SERVICE' to view descriptions of individual plans of a given service.

$ cf marketplace -s p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
Getting service plan information for service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard as user...
OK

service plan   description     free or paid
standard       Standard Plan   free
</pre>

Run `cf create-service`, specifying the service, plan name, and instance name.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard My\ Circuit\ Breaker\ Dashboard
Creating service instance My Circuit Breaker Dashboard in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
</pre>

## Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer. In the Marketplace, select **Circuit Breaker**.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/1_marketplace.png") %>

Select the desired plan for the new service.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/2_select_plan.png") %>

Provide a name for the service (for example, "My Circuit Breaker Dashboard"). Click the **Add** button.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/3_instance_name.png") %>

In the **Services** list, click the **Manage** link under the listing for the new service instance.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/4_service_successfully_added.png") %>

It may take a few minutes to provision the service; while it is being provisioned, you will see a "The service instance is initializing" message. Once the instance is ready, its dashboard will load automatically.

The Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance is now ready to be used. For an example of using a circuit breaker in an application, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/circuit-breaker/writing-client-applications.html">Writing Client Applications</a> subtopic.
