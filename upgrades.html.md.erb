## <a id="service-instance-upgrade-steps"></a>Service Instance Upgrade Steps

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Use of <code>cf update-service</code> to upgrade service instances is available only in Spring Cloud Services 1.0.4 and later.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: In the current version of Spring Cloud Services, upgrading a service instance will result in downtime for the instance while the upgrade is completed.</p>

After upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, follow the below steps to upgrade an individual service instance.

1. To see the current version of a service instance, visit the Service Instances Dashboard. (See the [Service Instances Dashboard](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#service-instances-dashboard) section of the [Operator Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) subtopic.)

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrades/si-dashboard-pre-upgrade.png") %>

1. Run `cf update-service -c '{"upgrade":true}' SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of a service instance:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service -c '{"upgrade":true}' config-server
    Updating service instance config-server as user...
    OK
    </pre>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>cf update-service</code> command begins the upgrade process. The actual upgrade may not have finished when the command exits.</p>

1. Wait while any backing applications belonging to the service instance are upgraded. The Dashboard will show the `RESTARTING` status for the instance.

1. When the service instance has been upgraded, the Dashboard will show the new version.
