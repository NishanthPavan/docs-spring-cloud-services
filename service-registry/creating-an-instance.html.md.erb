<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can create a Service Registry instance using either the cf Command Line Interface tool or [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Apps Manager.

## Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf target -o myorg -s development

API endpoint:   https://api.cf.wise.com (API version: 2.43.0)
User:           user
Org:            myorg
Space:          development
</pre>

If desired, view plan details for the Config Server product using `cf marketplace -s`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org myorg / space development as user...
OK

service                       plans          description
p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   standard       Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Spring Cloud Applications
p-config-server               standard       Config Server for Spring Cloud Applications
p-mysql                       100mb-dev      MySQL service for application development and testing
p-rabbitmq                    standard       RabbitMQ is a robust and scalable high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker.
p-service-registry            standard       Service Registry for Spring Cloud Applications

TIP:  Use 'cf marketplace -s SERVICE' to view descriptions of individual plans of a given service.

$ cf marketplace -s p-service-registry
Getting service plan information for service p-service-registry as user...
OK

service plan   description     free or paid
standard       Standard Plan   free
</pre>

Run `cf create-service`, specifying the service, plan name, and instance name.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service p-service-registry standard My\ Service\ Registry
Creating service instance My Service Registry in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
</pre>

## Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer. In the Marketplace, select **Service Registry**.

<%= image_tag("service-registry/1_marketplace.png") %>

Select the desired plan for the new service.

<%= image_tag("service-registry/2_select_plan.png") %>

Provide a name for the service (for example, "My Service Registry"). Click the **Add** button.

<%= image_tag("service-registry/3_instance_name.png") %>

In the **Services** list, click the **Manage** link under the listing for the new service instance.

<%= image_tag("service-registry/4_service_successfully_added.png") %>

It may take a few minutes to provision the service; while it is being provisioned, you will see a "The service instance is initializing" message. Once the instance is ready, its dashboard will load automatically.

<%= image_tag("service-registry/dashboard_more.png") %>

The Service Registry instance is now ready to be used. For information about registering a service application with the instance, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html">Writing Client Applications</a> subtopic.
