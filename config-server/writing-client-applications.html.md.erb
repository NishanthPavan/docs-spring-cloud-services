<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

_Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/tree/1.0.4">"Cook" sample application</a> to follow along with the code in this subtopic._

To use a Spring Boot application as a client for a Config Server instance, you must add the dependencies listed in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a> topic to your application's build file. Be sure to include the dependencies for <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html#config-server">Config Server</a> as well.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: Because of a dependency on <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">Spring Security</a>, the Spring Cloud&reg; Config Client starter will by default cause all application endpoints to be protected by HTTP Basic authentication. If you wish to disable this, please see <a href="#disable-http-basic-auth">Disable HTTP Basic Authentication</a> below.</p>

## <a id="self-signed-ssl-certificate"></a>Add Self-Signed SSL Certificate to JVM Truststore

Spring Cloud Services uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication. If your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) installation is using a self-signed SSL certificate, the certificate will need to be added to the JVM truststore before your client application can consume properties from a Config Server service instance.

Spring Cloud Services can add the certificate for you automatically. For this to work, you must set the ```CF_TARGET``` environment variable on your client application to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf set-env cook CF_TARGET https://api.cf.wise.com
Setting env variable 'CF_TARGET' to 'https://api.cf.wise.com' for app cook in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect

$ cf restage cook
</pre>

As the output from the ```cf set-env``` command suggests, restage the application after setting the environment variable.

## <a id="use-configuration-values"></a>Use Configuration Values

When the application requests a configuration from the Config Server, it will use a path containing the application name (as described in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/configuration-clients.html">Configuration Clients</a> subtopic). You can declare the application name in `bootstrap.properties`, `bootstrap.yml`, `application.properties`, or `application.yml`.

In <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml#L1-L3">`bootstrap.yml`</a>:

```yml
spring:
  application:
    name: cook
```

This application will use a path with the application name `cook`, so the Config Server will look in its configuration source for files whose names begin with `cook`, and return configuration properties from those files.

Now you can (for example) inject a configuration property value using the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html">`@Value`</a> annotation. <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/java/cook/Menu.java">The Menu</a> class reads the value of `special` from the `cook.special` configuration property.

```java
@RefreshScope
@Component
public class Menu {

  @Value("${cook.special}")
  String special;

  //...

  public String getSpecial() {
    return special;
  }

  //...

}
```

<a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/java/cook/Application.java">The `Application` class</a> is a [`@RestController`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html). It has an injected `menu` and returns the `special` (the value of which will be supplied by the Config Server) in its `restaurant()` method, which it maps to `/restaurant`.

```java
@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    @Autowired
    private Menu menu;

    @RequestMapping("/restaurant")
    public String restaurant() {
      return String.format("Today's special is: %s", menu.getSpecial());
    }
    //...
```

## <a id="vary-configurations-based-on-profiles"></a>Vary Configurations Based on Profiles

You can provide configurations for multiple profiles by including appropriately-named `.yml` or `.properties` files in the Config Server instance's configuration source (the Git repository). Filenames follow the format `{application}-{profile}.{extension}`, as in `cook-production.yml`. (See the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/server.html">The Config Server</a> subtopic.)

The application will request configurations for any active profiles. To set profiles as active, you can use the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable, set for example in <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/1.0.4/manifest.yml">`manifest.yml`</a>.

```yml
applications:
  - name: cook
    host: cookie
    services:
      - config-server
    env:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: production
```

The sample configuration source <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config">cook-config</a> contains the files `cook.properties` and `cook-production.properties`. With the active profile set to `production` as in `manifest.yml` above, the application will make a request of the Config Server using the path `/cook/production`, and the Config Server will return properties from both `cook-production.properties` (the profile-specific configuration) and `cook.properties` (the default configuration); for example:

```
{
  "name":"cook",
  "profiles":[
    "production"
  ],
  "label":"master",
  "propertySources":[
    {
      "name":"https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config/cook-production.properties",
      "source":
        {
          "cook.special":"Cake a la mode"
        }
    },
    {
      "name":"https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config/cook.properties",
      "source":
        {
          "cook.special":"Pickled Cactus"
        }
    }
  ]
}
```

As noted in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/configuration-clients.html">Configuration Clients</a> subtopic, the application must decide what to do when the server returns multiple values for a configuration property, but a Spring application will take the first value for each property. In the example response above, the configuration for the specified profile (`production`) is first in the list, so the Boot sample application will use values from that configuration.

## <a id="view-client-application-configuration"></a>View Client Application Configuration

<a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready">Spring Boot Actuator</a> adds an `env` endpoint to the application and maps it to `/env`. This endpoint displays the application's profiles and property sources from the Spring ```ConfigurableEnvironment```. (See ["Endpoints"](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html) in the "Spring Boot Actuator" section of the Spring Boot Reference Guide.) In the case of an application which is bound to a Config Server service instance, `env` will display properties provided by the instance.

To use Actuator, you must add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to your project. If using Maven, <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/1.0.4/pom.xml#L37-L40">add to `pom.xml`</a>:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If using Gradle, <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/1.0.4/build.gradle#L40">add to `build.gradle`</a>:

```groovy
compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
```

You can now visit `/env` to see the application environment's properties (the below example has been edited for brevity):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://cookie.wise.com/env
{
  "applicationConfig: [classpath:/application.yml]": {
      "spring.application.name": "cook"
  },
  "applicationConfig: [file:./application.yml]#dev": {
      "management.security.enabled": false,
      "security.basic.enabled": false,
      "spring.profiles": "dev"
  },
  "configService:https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config/cook.properties": {
      "cook.special": "Pickled Cactus"
  },
  "defaultProperties": {
      "spring.application.name": "bootstrap"
  },
  "profiles": [
      "dev",
      "cloud"
  ],
  # ...
</pre>

## <a id="refresh-client-application-configuration"></a>Refresh Client Application Configuration

Spring Boot Actuator also adds a `refresh` endpoint to the application. This endpoint is mapped to `/refresh`, and a POST request to the `refresh` endpoint refreshes any beans which are annotated with `@RefreshScope`. You can thus use `@RefreshScope` to refresh properties which were initialized with values provided by the Config Server.

The `Menu.java` class is <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/1.0.4/src/main/java/cook/Menu.java#L4-L12">marked as a `@Component` and also annotated with `@RefreshScope`</a>.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.context.config.annotation.RefreshScope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@RefreshScope
@Component
public class Menu {

  @Value("${cook.special}")
  String special;
  //...
```

This means that after you change values in the configuration source repository, you can update the `special` on the `Application` class's `menu` with a refresh event triggered on the application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://cookie.wise.com/restaurant
Today's special is: Pickled Cactus

$ git commit -am "new special"
[master 3c9ff23] new special
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

$ git push

$ curl -X POST http://cookie.wise.com/refresh
["cook.special"]

$ curl http://cookie.wise.com/restaurant
Today's special is: Birdfeather Tea
</pre>

## <a id="use-client-side-decryption"></a>Use Client-Side Decryption

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Use of Config Server to serve encrypted configuration values for client-side decryption is available only in Spring Cloud Services 1.0.4 and later.</p>

On the Config Server, the decryption features are disabled, so encrypted property values from a configuration source are delivered to client applications unmodified. You can use the decryption features of Spring Cloud Config Client to perform client-side decryption of encrypted values.

To use the decryption features in a client application, you must use a custom Java buildpack which contains the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength policy files. Download the files from Oracle, fork the [Cloud Foundry Java buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) on GitHub, and place the files in the `resources/open_jdk_jre/lib/security` directory. Then, following the instructions in the [Adding Buildpacks to Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html) topic, add your custom buildpack to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Make sure that it has the lowest position of all of the enabled Java buildpacks.

You must also include [Spring Security RSA](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-rsa) as a dependency and specify version 1.0.5.RELEASE of Spring Cloud Context in your client application's build file.

If using Maven, [include in `pom.xml`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/pom.xml#L53-L62):

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-security-rsa</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-context</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.5.RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>
```

If using Gradle, [include in `build.gradle`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/build.gradle#L42-L43):

```groovy
    compile("org.springframework.security:spring-security-rsa")
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-context:1.0.5.RELEASE")
```

Encrypted values must be prefixed with the string `{cipher}`. If using YAML, enclose the entire value in single quotes, as in `'{cipher}vALuE'`; if using a properties file, do not use quotes. The [configuration source for the Cook application](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config) has a [`secretMenu` property](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook-config/blob/master/cook.properties#L2) in its `cook.properties`:

```
secretMenu={cipher}AQA90Q3GIRAMu6ToMqwS++En2iFzMXIWX99G66yaZFRHrQNq64CntqOzWymd3xE7uJpZK
Qc9XBIkfyRz/HUGhXRdf3KZQ9bqclwmR5vkiLmN9DHlAxS+6biT+7f8ptKo3fzQ0gGOBaR4kTnWLBxmVaIkjq1Qz
e4aIgsgUWuhbEek+3znkH9+Mc+5zNPvwN8hhgDMDVzgZLB+4YnvWJAq3Au4wEevakAHHxVY0mXcxj1Ro+H+ZelIz
fF8K2AvC3vmvlmxy9Y49Zjx0RhMzUx17eh3mAB8UMMRJZyUG2a2uGCXmz+UunTA5n/dWWOvR3VcZyzXPFSFkhNek
w3db9XZ7goceJSPrRN+5s+GjLCPr+KSnhLmUt1XAScMeqTieNCHT5I=
```

Put the key on the client application classpath. In the Cook application, the key is in [`src/main/resources`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/tree/develop/src/main/resources).

```
cook
└── src
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── bootstrap.yml
            └── server.jks
```

Specify the key location and credentials in `bootstrap.properties` or [`bootstrap.yml`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml#L5-L10) using the `encrypt.keyStore` properties:

```yml
encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme
```

The Menu class has [a String property `secretMenu`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/java/cook/Menu.java#L14-L23), which is injected with the decrypted configuration value.

```java
  @Value("${secretMenu}")
  String secretMenu;

  //...

  public String getSecretMenu() {
    return secretMenu;
  }
```

In the Application class, [the method `secretMenu()` is mapped to `/restaurant/secret-menu`](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cook/blob/develop/src/main/java/cook/Application.java#L21-L24). It returns the value of the `secretMenu` property.

```java
    @RequestMapping("/restaurant/secret-menu")
    public String secretMenu() {
      return menu.getSecretMenu();
    }
```

## <a id="disable-http-basic-auth"></a>Disable HTTP Basic Authentication

The Spring Cloud Config Client starter has a dependency on <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">Spring Security</a>. Unless your application has other security configuration, this will cause all application endpoints to be protected by HTTP Basic authentication.

If you do not yet want to address application security, you can turn off Basic authentication by setting the `security.basic.enabled` property to `false`. In `application.yml` or `bootstrap.yml`:

```yml
security:
  basic:
    enabled: false
```

You might make this setting specific to a profile (such as the `dev` profile if you want Basic authentication disabled only for development):

```yml
---
spring:
  profiles: dev

security:
  basic:
    enabled: false
```

For more information, see ["Security" in the Spring Boot Reference Guide](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security).

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Because of the Spring Security dependency, HTTPS Basic authentication will also be enabled for Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. If you wish to disable that as well, you must also set the <code>management.security.enabled</code> property to <code>false</code>. See <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-management-server-port">"Customizing the management server port" in the Spring Boot Reference Guide</a>.</p>
